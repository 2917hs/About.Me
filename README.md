# 👋 Hi, I'm Hasan Siddiqui — Staff Software Engineer | Backend Engineer | Software Architect | Cloud-Native system | AI Enthusiast

Welcome to my GitHub! I'm a backend-focused software engineer with a strong foundation in cloud architecture, .NET, and Python ecosystems. I thrive on solving complex system design problems and integrating AI-powered solutions into real-world applications.

With hands-on experience across AWS and Azure, I build scalable, distributed, and fault-tolerant systems — and believe in writing clean, testable, and maintainable code.
