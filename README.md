# 👋 Hi, I'm Hasan Siddiqui — Staff Software Engineer | Backend Engineer | Software Architect | Cloud-Native Systems | AI Enthusiast

Welcome to my GitHub! I'm a backend-focused Staff Software Engineer with a strong foundation in cloud architecture, .NET, and Python ecosystems. I specialize in designing and delivering scalable, distributed systems — with a passion for clean code, system resiliency, and AI-powered automation.

With hands-on experience across both AWS and Azure, I lead initiatives that modernize legacy systems, introduce cloud-native practices, and apply Large Language Models (LLMs) to solve real-world business challenges.
